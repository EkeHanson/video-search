## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm/yarn
- Backend API running (see main documentation)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Update `.env` with your backend API URL:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1
```

### Development

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Building

Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

Preview production build:
```bash
npm run preview
```

### Linting

Check code quality:
```bash
npm run lint
```

- User endpoints: get credits
- Auth endpoints: register, login, logout, get current user

## Environment Variables

```env
# Required
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1

# Optional
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
VITE_ENABLE_SHARING=true
```

## API Integration

The frontend expects the backend API to provide:

### Generate Demo
```javascript
POST /api/v1/generate
{
  "prompt": "Teach me how to cook Egusi soup",
  "language": "en",
  "quality": "hd",
  "voice": "female-nigerian"
}

Response:
{
  "demo_id": "uuid",
  "status": "processing",
  "estimated_time": 45
}
```

### Get Demo Status
```javascript
GET /api/v1/demo/{id}

Response:
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "prompt": "...",
  "status": "completed|processing|failed",
  "progress_percent": 75,
  "video_url": "...",
  "thumbnail_url": "...",
  "duration": 120,
  "file_size": 52428800,
  "steps": [
    {
      "step_number": 1,
      "title": "...",
      "description": "...",
      "media": "..."
    }
  ],
  "created_at": "...",
  "completed_at": "..."
}
```

### Get History
```javascript
GET /api/v1/history?page=1&limit=10

Response:
{
  "demos": [...],
  "total": 42,
  "total_pages": 5
}
```

## Styling

The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Custom styles are minimal:
- `.spinner`: Loading animation
- `.fade-in`: Fade in animation
- `.slide-up`: Slide up animation

Classes automatically generated by Tailwind:
- Responsive design with `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` prefixes
- Color utilities for primary, secondary, success, danger colors
- Layout utilities for flexbox, grid, spacing

## Authentication

Currently, authentication tokens are stored in `localStorage` under the key `access_token`. The API client automatically adds this to request headers.

To implement login:
1. Call `authAPI.login(email, password)`
2. Store returned token: `localStorage.setItem('access_token', token)`
3. Token will be included in all subsequent API requests

## Browser Support

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Performance Considerations

- Images are lazy-loaded
- Video player uses ReactPlayer's lightweight implementation
- API calls are cached where appropriate
- Tailwind CSS is optimized in production build

## Troubleshooting

### API Connection Error
- Ensure backend API is running on the URL specified in `.env`
- Check CORS settings on the backend

### Demo Generation Timeout
- Demos can take 2-5 minutes to generate
- The page automatically polls the backend every 3 seconds
- Larger demos or higher quality may take longer

### Video Not Playing
- Verify video URL is accessible
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Ensure backend is serving proper video format

## Future Enhancements

- User authentication UI
- Subscription/payment integration
- Advanced filtering in history
- Video editing capabilities
- Comments and ratings system
- AI-powered recommendations
- Mobile app (React Native)
